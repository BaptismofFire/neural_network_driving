‚ñ∂Ô∏èÔ∏è HOW TO RUN?
Install packages
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

NeuralNetworkRacing/requirements.txt

Lines 1 to 3 in e6ff65a

 pyglet == 1.5.29 
 numpy 
 pillow 
Run main file
Should work with Python 3.0 and higher.

For example:

py -3.10 .\__main__.py
Or use a virtual environment.

Config (Optional)
config.json

```
{
    "width": 1280
    "height": 720
    "friction": 0.1
    "render_timestep": 0.025 // time between frames in seconds - 0.025s = 40 FPS
    "timeout_seconds": 30 // maximum time for each gen
    "population": 40 // number of cars
    "mutation_rate": 0.6 // mutation rate after gen
}
```

default_nn_config.json - Default car config for new saves.
```
{
    "name" : "test" 
    "acceleration": 1
    "friction": 0.95
    "max_speed": 30 
    "rotation_speed": 4
    "shape": [6, 4, 3, 2] // neural network shape - do not change first and last layer
    "max_score": 0
    "gen_count": 0
}

üß¨ EVOLUTION
Best cars in each generation are chosen to be the parents of the next, slightly mutated generation.
